# Audio-Classification 

This project leverages machine learning to classify urban sounds using the UrbanSound8K dataset. Audio features are extracted through Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), a commonly employed method in audio processing. These features are then used to train a deep learning model, typically a neural network, to categorize sounds into various classes.
